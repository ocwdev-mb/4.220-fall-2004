Student Research Project
------------------------

Until the twentieth century, urban housing was an integral part of the city; e.g. the French Hotel, the Paris apartment building, the London townhouse, and the New York row house and apartment building. In contrast, most twentieth century housing is either suburban or anti-urban. Beginning around 1975, however, a new sensibility emerged regarding housing and the city, and new more integral urban housing projects were designed.

Each student should choose an (approved) urban housing project done after 1975 to research and present to the class. The presentation must also be submitted as a report in both hard copy and electronic file.
